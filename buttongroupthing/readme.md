This is the code I (Gavin) made for a vertical button arrangment (called a button group) which can change a label upon pressing the, "ok" key, however does not differentiate which button in the list is being pressed (yet).

BY THE WAY, pressing "ok" ONLY causes a print statement in this example, so check your console and add something else in the function
if you want to make it do something else like change a label or something.

make sure to zip correctly!!!!!!!

its all in xml so if you have questions, feel free to pop them on me.
